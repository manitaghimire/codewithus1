ABOUT PROJECT
This project is built using HTML, CSS, slight Javascript and core PHP without any framework. Code with us is a code review and discussion forum. It is built around the idea of stack overflow where a user can post questions related to programming by chosing a category of that programming language and the questions can be answered by other users using the platform, and a discussion can take place between programmers. There is another section i.e review section where users can post their code and ask for review by other users. Thus programmers can interact with one another in the comment section.
